# Description of the project #

The subject of my work was to design and implement a file-manager application that allows seamless interaction between a personal computer and an android-enabled mobile device. The application enables the user to transfer files, open remote files with common media formats and  start/stop programs running on the host PC.

This makes it possible to use a personal computer from anywhere, provided we have a smartphone and both devices are connected to the internet.
